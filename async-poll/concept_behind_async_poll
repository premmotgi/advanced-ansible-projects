1. Basically when you have multiple scripts running from your playbook, ansible runs each task and waits till the task finishes
and then moves to the next task.
2. But, this would take alot of time
3. This would also make it synchronous
4. To make it little asynchronous in terms of execution to save some time for playbook execution async can be used.
5. With async ansible knows for how much time we have to execute the script. After this specified time ansible moves to next task.
6. Now if we want the script to move immediately after this time, we have to use poll. So that ansible keeps on checking the status again.
7. when you use poll, default time is 10 seconds to check for ansible. that is after every 10 secs it will check if async operation is finished
8. Also, if we set value of poll to 0, it will achieve more or less paralell execution  for tasks.
9. Usually you can save status of tasks in a variable and set polling to 0 for all the tasks. Then, you can keep checking status
every while to see if script execution is finished. in short, setting polling value to zero means ansible wont do polling for it and instead will
move to next task.
