1) To store any details in key value pair, file lookups can be used.
2) This could be done for any type of file that uses key value pairs


csv file contents:

Hostname,Password
target1,Password234

{{ lookup('csvfile', 'target1 file=/tml/creds.csv delimiter=,')}} => Password234

first argument is type of file
second argument is what you want to lookup for (when you want to know what value does a key holds, and provide key as input)
third argument is file name
fourth argument is delimeter to lookup (for ex, in csv delimeters are "," or commas)


You can just use the ansible_ssh_pass parameter to pass password:

- name: some task
  shell: "echo 'hello world'"
  ansible_ssh_pass: raspberry
